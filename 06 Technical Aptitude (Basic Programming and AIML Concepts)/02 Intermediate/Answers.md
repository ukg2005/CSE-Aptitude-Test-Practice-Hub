## Programming Fundamentals (1–20)

1. **Question**: What is the output of this C code: `int x = 5; printf("%d %d", x++, ++x);`?  
   **Solution**:  
   In `printf`, arguments are evaluated right-to-left. `++x` increments `x` to 6, then `x++` uses 6 and increments `x` to 7. Output: `6 6`.  
   **Answer**: 6 6

2. **Question**: In Python, what is the output of: `x = [1, 2, 3]; y = x; y[0] = 4; print(x)`?  
   **Solution**:  
   `y = x` creates a reference to the same list. Modifying `y[0]` changes `x`. Output: `[4, 2, 3]`.  
   **Answer**: [4, 2, 3]

3. **Question**: In Java, what is the output of: `String s = "hello"; s = s.concat(" world"); System.out.println(s);`?

   **Answer**: 10

5. **Question**: In Python, what is the output of: `def f(x): x += 1; x = 5; f(x); print(x)`?  
   **Solution**:

    **Answer**: -6

16. **Question**: In Java, what is the output of: `int x = 8; System.out.println(x >> 1);`?  
    **Solution**:  
    `x >> 1` right-shifts `8` (binary `1000`) to `0100` (4).  
    **Answer**: 4

97. **Question**: What is the purpose of the softmax function in neural networks?  
    **Solution**:  
    Converts logits to probabilities for multi-class classification.  
    **Answer**: Probability conversion

98. **Question**: What is the role of k in k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)?  
    **Solution**:  
    Number of neighbors considered for prediction.  
    **Answer**: Neighbor count

99. **Question**: What is the difference between bagging and boosting in ML?  
    **Solution**:  
    Bagging: parallel ensembles (e.g., Random Forest); Boosting: sequential, corrects errors (e.g., AdaBoost).  
    **Answer**: Bagging: parallel, Boosting: sequential

100. **Question**: What is the purpose of principal component analysis (PCA) in ML?  
     **Solution**:  
     Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components.  
     **Answer**: Dimensionality reduction
