# 100 Technical Aptitude Practice Questions (Basic Level) (Answers Only)

## Programming Fundamentals (1–20)

1. **Question**: What is the output of this C code: `int x = 5; printf("%d", x++);`?  
   **Solution**:  
   `x++` is post-increment, so `printf` uses the current value of `x` (5), then increments `x` to 6.  
   **Answer**: 5

2. **Question**: In Python, what is the output of: `print(3 * "hello")`?  
   **Solution**:  
   String repetition in Python multiplies the string: `3 * "hello"` produces `"hellohellohello"`.  
   **Answer**: hellohellohello

3. **Question**: What is the value of `x` after this Java code: `int x = 10; x += 5;`?  
   **Solution**:  
   `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`. So, `x = 10 + 5 = 15`.  
   **Answer**: 15

4. **Question**: In C++, what is the output of: `int a = 3, b = 4; cout << a + b;`?  
   **Solution**:

    **Answer**: [2]

14. **Question**: In C++, what is the output of: `int x = 4; cout << ++x;`?  
    **Solution**:  
    `++x` is pre-increment, so `x` becomes `5`, and `5` is printed.  
    **Answer**: 5

15. **Question**: In C, what is the output of: `int x = 5; printf("%d", x | 2);`?
